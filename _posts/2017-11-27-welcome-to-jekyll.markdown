Millions of people use messengers every day, but their place in the world of fully functional apps isn’t totally clear. One the one hand, they were created to enable communication without relying on operators like SMS, which had plenty of downsides. That’s why the first messengers were so popular.

On the other hand, messengers displace social networks more and more. Even now, there’s a flood of new messenger apps with new features, and the demand for them remains sky-high. There’s an identifiable trend to messengers where each one tries to one-up every other and add that little bit of flair that nobody else has.tter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight python %}
def fib(n):
 a,b = 1,1
 for i in range(n-1):
  a,b = b,a+b
 return a
print fib(5)
{% endhighlight %}
